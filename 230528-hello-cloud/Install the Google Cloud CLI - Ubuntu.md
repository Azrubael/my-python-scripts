In the Google Cloud console, on the project selector page, select or create a *Google Cloud project*.
Make sure that billing is enabled for your Cloud project. Learn how to check if billing is enabled on a project.

*Installing the latest gcloud CLI version (425.0.0)*
Package contents
The gcloud CLI is available in package format for installation on Debian and Ubuntu systems. This package contains the gcloud, gcloud alpha, gcloud beta, gsutil, and bq commands only. It doesn't include kubectl or the App Engine extensions required to deploy an application using gcloud commands. If you want these components, you must install them separately:
https://cloud.google.com/sdk/docs/install-sdk#deb-additional

*Before begin*
Before you install the gcloud CLI, make sure that your operating system meets the following requirements:
- An Ubuntu release that hasn't reached end-of-life or a Debian stable release that hasn't reached end-of-life
- apt-transport-https is installed:
	$ sudo apt-get install apt-transport-https ca-certificates gnupg
	
=====================================================================	
## Installation
###(1) Add the gcloud CLI distribution URI as a package source. 
~~~If your distribution supports the signed-by option, run the following command:
	$ echo "deb [signed-by=/usr/share/keyrings/cloud.google.gpg] https://packages.cloud.google.com/apt cloud-sdk main" | sudo tee -a /etc/apt/sources.list.d/google-cloud-sdk.list~~~
	
If your distribution doesn't support the signed-by option, run the following command:
	$ echo "deb https://packages.cloud.google.com/apt cloud-sdk main" | sudo tee -a /etc/apt/sources.list.d/google-cloud-sdk.list
	
*NOTE* Make sure you don't have duplicate entries for the cloud-sdk repo in
/etc/apt/sources.list.d/google-cloud-sdk.list.

If your distribution (Debian 11+ or Ubuntu 21.10+) doesn't support apt-key, run the following command:
	$ curl https://packages.cloud.google.com/apt/doc/apt-key.gpg | sudo tee /usr/share/keyrings/cloud.google.gpg

###(2) Import the Google Cloud public key.	
If you can't get latest updates due to an expired key, obtain the latest apt-get.gpg key file.

###(3) Update and install the gcloud CLI:
	$ sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install google-cloud-cli
If apt-key command is not supported:
	$ RUN echo "deb [signed-by=/usr/share/keyrings/cloud.google.gpg] http://packages.cloud.google.com/apt cloud-sdk main" | tee -a /etc/apt/sources.list.d/google-cloud-sdk.list && curl https://packages.cloud.google.com/apt/doc/apt-key.gpg | tee /usr/share/keyrings/cloud.google.gpg && apt-get update -y && apt-get install google-cloud-sdk -y
