1) How to determine if a subnet in the format 'X.X.X.X/Y' is a public or a private?
---

To determine if a subnet in the format 'X.X.X.X/Y' is a public or a private IP address, you can check the range of the first octet in the IP address.

For IPv4 addresses:
Private IP addresses are reserved for use within private networks and are not routable on the internet. The following ranges are reserved for private networks:
        10.0.0.0 to 10.255.255.255
        172.16.0.0 to 172.31.255.255
        192.168.0.0 to 192.168.255.255
If the IP address falls within these ranges, it is a private IP address. If the IP address does not fall within these ranges, it is a public IP address.

For IPv6 addresses, the concept of public and private addresses is different due to the vast address space and the use of Unique Local Addresses (ULAs) for local communication. However, in general, the same concept applies where a specific range of IPv6 addresses are reserved for private use.



2) How to determine how many hosts does a subnet in the format 'X.X.X.X/Y'  contains?
---

To determine the number of hosts a subnet in the format 'X.X.X.X/Y' contains, you can use the formula:
    [2^{32-Y} - 2]
Where Y is the number after the slash in the subnet notation.

For example, if you have a subnet in the format '192.168.1.0/24', to determine the number of hosts in this subnet:
    Y = 24 [2^{32-24} - 2 = 2^8 - 2 = 256 - 2 = 254]
So, the subnet '192.168.1.0/24' contains 254 hosts.



3) How to determine which class (A,B,C) a subnet in the format 'X.X.X.X'  belongs to?
---

To determine the class (A, B, or C) of a subnet in the format 'X.X.X.X', you can examine the value of the first octet in the IP address:

Class A: If the first octet of the IP address falls within the range 1-126, the subnet belongs to Class A.
Class B: If the first octet of the IP address falls within the range 128-191, the subnet belongs to Class B.
Class C: If the first octet of the IP address falls within the range 192-223, the subnet belongs to Class C.
These are the traditional classful IP address ranges, but it's important to note that in modern networking, CIDR (Classless Inter-Domain Routing) is used, and IP addresses are often subnetted regardless of their original class.



4) How to determine which class (A,B,C) a subnet in the format 'X.X.X.X'  belongs to?
---
In modern networking, the concept of IP address classes has been largely superseded by Classless Inter-Domain Routing (CIDR), where the subnet mask is denoted by the "/Y" notation.

To properly determine the class of a subnet in the format 'X.X.X.X/Y', the following rules must be considered:

Class A: If the first octet of the IP address falls within the range 1-126, and the subnet mask is /8 to /15.
Class B: If the first octet of the IP address falls within the range 128-191, and the subnet mask is /16 to /23.
Class C: If the first octet of the IP address falls within the range 192-223, and the subnet mask is /24 to /31.
Additionally, it's important to consider that CIDR allows for the subnetting of IP addresses within any class, so the class-based classification is less relevant in modern networking. 



5) How to divide the network into subnets based on the number of hosts in each of the subnets and using a fixed length subnet mask (FLSM)?
---

1. Determine the number of hosts needed in each subnet.
2. Calculate the number of bits required to accommodate the needed number of hosts. This can be done using the formula: 
   \[2^n \geq \text{number of hosts} + 2\]
   Where n is the number of bits required.
3. Calculate the subnet mask by adding the number of bits required to the default subnet mask. For example, if you are using Class C address (default subnet mask /24), and you need 100 hosts per subnet, you would add 7 bits (2^7 = 128) to the default subnet mask, making it /24 + 7 = /31.
4. Divide the network based on the new subnet mask, making sure to align the subnets with the number of hosts required.

For example, if you have a Class C network (192.168.1.0/24) and you need 100 hosts per subnet, you would calculate the number of bits required, then create subnets using the new subnet mask.

Keep in mind that when using FLSM, the number of hosts in each subnet will be fixed and may result in unused address space in some subnets.



6) How to divide the network with network address 172.16.0.0/20 into subnets with 120 hosts using a fixed length subnet mask (FLSM)?
---

1. Determine the number of bits required to accommodate 120 hosts. The formula for calculating the number of bits required is:
   \[2^n \geq \text{number of hosts} + 2\]
   For 120 hosts, you need at least 7 bits (\(2^7 = 128\)) to accommodate the hosts.

2. Add the 7 bits to the existing subnet mask of /20. This will give you a new subnet mask of /27 (\(20 + 7 = 27\)).

3. Calculate the new subnet mask in binary. In this case, the subnet mask in binary will be 11111111.11111111.11111111.11100000, which translates to 255.255.255.224 in decimal notation.

4. Divide the network address 172.16.0.0/20 using the new subnet mask of /27. Each subnet will have 32 IP addresses (\(2^{32-27} - 2 = 32 - 2 = 30\)), which will accommodate 30 hosts.

Since 30 is less than 120, we need to use a larger subnet size. Therefore, we need to use a larger subnet to accommodate 120 hosts. With 7 bits, we can accommodate 128 hosts, which is more than 120.

So, using FLSM, you can divide the network 172.16.0.0/20 into subnets with 120 hosts each by using a subnet mask of /25, and each subnet will have the following ranges:
- Subnet 1: 172.16.0.0 - 172.16.0.127
- Subnet 2: 172.16.0.128 - 172.16.0.255
- Subnet 3: 172.16.1.0 - 172.16.1.127
- Subnet 4: 172.16.1.128 - 172.16.1.255
- ... and so on.


7) How to divide the network into subnets based on the number of hosts in each of the subnets and using a variable length subnet mask (VLSM)?
---

1. Determine the number of hosts needed in each subnet.
2. Create a list of the subnets you need, ordered by the number of hosts required, from largest to smallest.
3. Start subnetting the largest subnet first, using the number of hosts required to determine the subnet mask needed. Allocate the required number of hosts to the subnet and assign an appropriate IP range.
4. Move on to the next largest subnet and repeat the process, using the remaining address space in the original network and the new subnets you have created.
5. Continue this process for all the subnets you need, using the remaining address space each time.

For example, if you have a Class C network (192.168.1.0/24) and you need the following subnets:
- Subnet A: 200 hosts
- Subnet B: 100 hosts
- Subnet C: 50 hosts

You would start by subnetting for Subnet A, then move on to Subnet B, and finally Subnet C, using the remaining address space each time.

VLSM allows for efficient use of address space by allocating different-sized subnets based on specific needs, and it's commonly used in modern network design to optimize address allocation.
