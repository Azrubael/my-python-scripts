How to Use PIL for Working With Images

When using PIL, we typically create Image objects that hold the data associated with the images that we want to process. On these objects, we operate by calling different methods that either return a new image object or modify the data in the image, and then end up saving the result in a different file.

	$ ./03-resize.py
Resize an image 'example.jpg' and save the new image with a new name

	$ ./04-rotate.py
Rotate an image 'example.jpg' on 90*

There's a ton more that you can do with the PIL library. Have a look at the docs and try it on your computer!
