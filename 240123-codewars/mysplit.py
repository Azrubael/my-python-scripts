"""
A function, which behaves almost exactly like the original split() method, i.e.:
1. it should accept exactly one argument â€“ a string;
2. it should return a list of words created from the string, divided in the places where the string contains whitespaces;
3. if the string is empty, the function should return an empty list;
4. its name should be mysplit()
