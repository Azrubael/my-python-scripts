"""
The pizza delivery service processes its orders on the first come, first served basis. After a client has paid for his/her order, he/she is added to the online waiting list. After the pizza is ready, the information is passed to a courier, saved to a file, and removed from the waiting list. Display the number of customers who are currently waiting for an order. (Hint: to implement the task in C, use the structure that describes the concept of an order, with the properties: visitor's name, delivery address, order, total cost. An order is written from the waiting list to the file when it is deleted).

Expected functionality:

    Enter the info (customer's name, address, order, total cost).
    Write to file â€“ delete the order data.
    Display the number of customers waiting for the order (customer's name, address, total cost).
