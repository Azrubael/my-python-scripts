/*
A new film was released at the cinema. There is 1 hall in the cinema and it can fit 200 spectators. Every day, a different number of tickets were sold for a new film in the first and second weeks of its running. When did the cinema sell more tickets â€“ during the first or the second week? What was the revenue of the cinema in the first two weeks of the movie's distribution, if the price of one ticket is $M?
