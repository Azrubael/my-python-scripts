"""
all of the advantages of cooperative multitasking get thrown away if one of the tasks doesn’t cooperate. A minor mistake in code can cause a task to run off and hold the processor for a long time, starving other tasks that need running. There is no way for the event loop to break in if a task does not hand control back to it.
